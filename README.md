# SteamLevels
### *Description*

This web app will get the user input ( User - Wanted level ) then call the Steam API to get more information about the user ( Current Level - XP - and some other basic info ...) then calculate the sets and the cost to get to the wanted level.

If you want to clone the project make sure to change the Steam_API_Key on the index.js and i recommend using dotenv before deploying your project so you  dont share your api key publicly.


### *Demo*

This application is deployed on Heroku. Please check it out [Here](https://github.com/Mistydz/)
